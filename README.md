# MCVE for Configurable class without ConfigureUtil

I am working on https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-gradle-plugin/pull/609 and want to remove dependencies on `ConfigureUtil` which will removed from Gradle v8.0.

## Problem

There is a [class implements `Report` interface](https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-gradle-plugin/blob/beta/src/main/groovy/com/github/spotbugs/snom/SpotBugsReport.java#L114-L118) so it defines a method like below:

```java
@Override
public Report configure(Closure closure) {
    ConfigureUtil.configureSelf(closure, this);
    return this;
}
```

According to the [official Javadoc](https://docs.gradle.org/7.3/javadoc/org/gradle/util/ConfigureUtil.html), *Gradle automatically generates a Closure-taking method at runtime for each method with an Action as a single argument as long as the object is created with `ObjectFactory.newInstance(Class, Object...)`.*

However, even though there is a method like below, Gradle cannot generate its instance and reports `Could not generate a decorated class` and its reason is `Cannot have abstract method Configurable.configure()`:

```java
public Report configure(Action<Report> action) {
    action.execute(this);
    return this;
}
```

[`ClosureBackedAction` is also deprecated](https://docs.gradle.org/7.3/javadoc/org/gradle/util/ClosureBackedAction.html) so I have no idea about how to resolve this situation.

## How to reproduce the build failure

Simply checkout this repository, and run `./gradlew build` then you will find exceptions like below:

```txt
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* Where:
Build file '/Users/kengo/GitHub/mcve-configurable/build.gradle.kts' line: 6

* What went wrong:
Could not create an instance of type Build_gradle$ConfigurableClass.
> Could not generate a decorated class for type Build_gradle.ConfigurableClass.
   > Cannot have abstract method Configurable.configure().

* Try:
> Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace.
> Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output.
> Run with --scan to get full insights.
